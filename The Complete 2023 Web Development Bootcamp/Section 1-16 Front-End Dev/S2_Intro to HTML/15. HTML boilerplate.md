# 15. HTML boiler plate
The boiler-plate is a structure with which we always start to make a html website (or **HTML Hamburger :hamburger:!**)
The code below explains all the basics of HTML boiler-plate through comment. ⬇️

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <!-- DOCTYPE indicates the HTML version we use to build the file to the brower or renderer-->
    
    <html lang="en">
    <!-- All the contents are included under the angular html sign. We can add attributes such as 'lang' to this element.-->
      <head>
      <!-- Head section includes all the important infomation or settings which are not going to be displayed to the users.-->
      
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <!-- meta element represents the mata-data of the HTML file and could not have any content as it is a void element. However meta can have attributes and we can also have multiple meta elements.-->
        <title>My Website</title>
        <!-- title element defines the name displayed on the tab.>
        
      </head>
      
      <body>
      <!-- body section is where we have all the MEAT of the HTML file. Everything displayed to users should be included here.>
        <h1> Hello world! </h1>
      </body>
    </html>
