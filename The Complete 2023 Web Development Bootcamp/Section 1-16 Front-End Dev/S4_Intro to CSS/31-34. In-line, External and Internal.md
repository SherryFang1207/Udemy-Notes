# 31-34. In-line, External and Internal
CSS is a styling language, and it is usually implemented with `<style>` key tag/word.    
## In-line CSS
In-line CSS has the highest priority. The syntax is as below:
```
<body style="color:yellow; border:none;">
</body>
```
## Internal CSS
Internal CSS has the lowest priority compared to other two. Instead of adding `style` attribute to html elements, internal CSS are implemented inside the `head` section of html file 
and use `<style>` html tags. The syntax is as below:
```
<style>
  selector {
    property1: value1;
    property2: value2;
  }
</style>
```

## External CSS
External CSS are the most convinient and useful one as it can be refered inside a html file. The syntax is as below:
```
  selector {
    property1: value1;
    property2: value2;
  }
  selector {
    property1: value1;
    property2: value2;
  }
  ...
```
