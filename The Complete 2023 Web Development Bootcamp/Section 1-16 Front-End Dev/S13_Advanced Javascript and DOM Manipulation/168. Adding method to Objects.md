# 168. Adding method to Objects
Thus Objects can perform actions.
## Adding method via Object Literal
[Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp)
```
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```
## Adding method via Object Constructor Function
[Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_constructors.asp)
```
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
  this.name = function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  };
}
```
