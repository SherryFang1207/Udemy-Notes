# 162. Adding Event Listener to a Button
[Adding an Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) to an Javascript object (or simply any elements in the html structure file) makes the selected element listen to **events that have specific types** and call functions when events are triggered. Thus JavaScript can make html elements interactive by having them execute functions under specific [events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)/ conditions. <br>

## Codes

```
addEventListener(type, listener);
```
## Sample Usage

```
var numOfDrums = document.querySelectorAll(".drum").length;

for (var i = 0; i < numOfDrums; i ++){
    document.querySelectorAll(".drum")[i].addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("I got clicked!");
    });
}
```
## Using anonymous functions as arguments
See this [page](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-anonymous-functions/). Anonymous functions are always used as inline functions which are passes as a parameter.   

## Passing functions as parameter in JavaScript
Note that when passing functions as parameters, ***ALWAYS ONLY pass the FUNCTION NAME.*** Or the functions written like `func()` will be run immediately by the compiler.   
It's the same in [python usage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passing-function-as-an-argument-in-python/).
