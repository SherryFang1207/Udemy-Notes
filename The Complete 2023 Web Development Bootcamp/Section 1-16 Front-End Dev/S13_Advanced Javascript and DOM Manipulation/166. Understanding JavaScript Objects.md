# 166. Understanding JavaScript Objects
Typically, `objects` are constructed and used along with `classes`. For example, in Python, you always need [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) to build objects and [constructor function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-python/) is the initiated part of the corresponding class. (you can't just run constructor functions to build objects without having a class). <br>
HOWEVER, in JavaScript, you can have stand-alone constructor functions to build objects without classes. (although JavaScript does have classes).
