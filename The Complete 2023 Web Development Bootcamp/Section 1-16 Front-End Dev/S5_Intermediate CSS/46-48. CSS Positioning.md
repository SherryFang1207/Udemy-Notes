To check documentations, go to [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.php).
#### How HTML elements get positioned as Default
1. Content is Everything -- Content decides the size of the element
2. Order comes from the Code -- Contents are rendered following the order of the code
3. Children sit on Parents -- Children elements are `closer` to the viewer in terms of `Z` axis

   - position changes are relative to its self-margin
3. `Absolute`
   - position changes are relative to its parent-margin
   - note that `Absolute` positioning will not be recognized in the normal element flow
4. `Fixed` elements stay in the same places and won't move when you scroll the webpage
