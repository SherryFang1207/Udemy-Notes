# 50. Font Styling
The [font-family](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.php) property specifies the font for an element.   

The font-family property can hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font.   
#### Code Example:
`font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;`   
## Web Safe Fonts
[Web Safe Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php) are fonts that are generally safe to use. However, we could not promise that everyone have these safe fonts installed.   
Therefore, always use font stack as fall-back and use **Font Embedding**.   
## Font Embedding
The ALLMIGHTY google has support for [this!](https://fonts.google.com/)    
Copy the links and paste them into head section to embed fonts in your webpage.
