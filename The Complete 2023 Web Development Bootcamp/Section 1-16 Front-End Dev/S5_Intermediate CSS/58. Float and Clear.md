# 58. Float and Clear
Use [Float](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_float.php) to `float` the element to certain position and other in-line elements and texts will wrap around it.   
```
float:left;
```
To avoid float around in a specific direction, use [clear](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_clear.php) property.   
```
clear:left; This will cancel out the effect above
```
