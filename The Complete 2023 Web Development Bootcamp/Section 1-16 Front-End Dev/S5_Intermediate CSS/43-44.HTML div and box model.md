# 43-44.HTML div and box model
`div` in HTML stands for divisor - it divides the HTML contents into boxes (in fact, EVERY item in HTML is just a box). <br>
The box model is a structure which we can manipulate the styling with, which includes: `content`, `padding`, `background image`, `background color`, `border` and `margin`.   
### Syntax for div
    <div class="someClass" id="anID">
      <contents go here...>
    </div>
Note that `div` itself is a tag, and can have `class` and `id` attributes.

Note that at this point we can only set `div` in different rows. To set `div` side by side, keep learning. ðŸ˜Ž
