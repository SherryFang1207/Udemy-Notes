# 53. CSS Sizing
## Font Properties
1. Static Size: won't change even though user set other sizing preferences
    ```
    font-size:90px;
    ```
2. Dynamic Size: Will change if user has specific sizing preferences
    ```
    font-size:100%; /*Here, 100% == 16px*/
    ```
    ```
    font-size:1em; /*Here, 1em == 16px*/
    ```
    However, note that both `em` and `%` can be inherited from parent element. (which we don't want at all, usually)   
    Use `rem`, which will not be affected by the upstream size changes!   
    ```
    font-size:1rem; /*Here, 1rem == 16px*/
    ```
